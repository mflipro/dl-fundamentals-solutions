##  # Exercise 2: Confidence Intervals

If you want to practice using the confidence interval method introduced in this lecture, tru to compute a confidence interval for the MNIST classifier from Unit 4 using [this template](exercise_2-template.ipynb).

Hint: In this case, since it's a relatively large test set, the confidence interval is less than a percentage point wide. 

And for a more advanced challenge, you can also try to implement the [other 3 confidence interval methods](https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2022/confidence-intervals-for-ml.html)  for this MNIST classifier.
